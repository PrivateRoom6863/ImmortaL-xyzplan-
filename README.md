Cheat plugin which aims to improve your gameplay desire by giving yourself an invincible ship, making other flagships, escorts Invincible, automaton, alter their mass, speed, one-hit attack, have infinite money by outfits, and etc. The mod isn't All-content plugin but was inspired by other mods like Omnis, and ruin-the-fuin instead because of the cool features they had when I didn't create the mod before.

Note that:
Ruinous executor ship was from SRPG-4 while the rest like outfits, turrets, and sounds are from vanilla or might be from other sources. So, instead, all rightful assets goes to the respective owner.

If you think that there's something wrong or want to suggest about the mod, ping me at endless sky discord #plugin-chat or dm me .xyzplan.

Thanks:
